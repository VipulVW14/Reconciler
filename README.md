# Todo App Reconciler

A TypeScript-based Todo App reconciler that efficiently updates the DOM by comparing a virtual DOM (vDOM) with the actual DOM. This reconciler is specifically designed for dynamic rendering and manipulation of a Todo list.

## Overview

This reconciler uses a virtual DOM to represent the state of the Todo list and performs efficient updates by reconciling it with the actual DOM. The application showcases the addition, deletion, and update of Todo list items, providing insights into how the reconciler optimizes rendering.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rendering:** The reconciler dynamically renders Todo list items based on the virtual DOM state.
- **Efficient Updates:** Updates to the Todo list are optimized by comparing the virtual DOM with the actual DOM.
- **Random Data Generation:** The application generates some Todo items at regular intervals to simulate real-world data changes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-reconciler.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. Explore the dynamic rendering and updating of the Todo list.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the necessary scripts.
- **reconciler.ts**: The TypeScript file containing the Todo App reconciler logic.
- **reconciler.js**: The compiled JavaScript file generated from the TypeScript code.
- **styles.css**: Basic styles for the Todo list elements.

## How it Works

1. **Virtual DOM (vDOM):** The reconciler maintains a virtual DOM that mirrors the state of the Todo list.

2. **Random Todo Generation:** Every 5 seconds, a batch of randomly generated Todo items is created.

3. **Reconciliation:** The reconciler efficiently updates the actual DOM by reconciling the vDOM with the current state.

4. **Console Logging:** The console logs the number of items added, updated, and deleted after each reconciliation.

## Development

To modify the reconciler or add new features, follow these steps:

1. Make changes to the `reconciler.ts` file.
2. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:

   ```bash
   tsc reconciler.ts
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the updated reconciler in action.
